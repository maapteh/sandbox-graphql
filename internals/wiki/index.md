# GraphQL Workshop Tutorial

Welcome to the tutorial accompanying the GraphQL workshop. This purpose of this tutorial is to get you up and running with GraphQL andnd to introduce the most important concepts of using GraphQL.

There are 3 parts to this tutorial:

-   Fundamentals: Chapters with assignments to step-by-step build a GraphQL api and web application, including solutions
-   Testing: Explains 3 possible testing strategies
-   Final Project: A final assignment to build a SpaceX application, including solutions

To get the most out of this workshop we recommend solving the assignments on your own, and using the solutions as comparison or if you're really stuck . The workshop presentation together with the information in the chapters contain everything you need to solve the assignments.

Some programming experience in C-style languages (JS, TS, Java, etc.) is required. In this tutorial we use TypesScript, we try to explain the syntax and keep it simple as we go along. But you might have to lookup a TypeScript API if certain code looks unfamiliar.

If you get stuck or can't solve an assignment, we still encourage you to follow along and learn about GraphQL by reviewing the chapter solutions.

We have also created a ["GraphQL Workshop"](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3afa394fa727b14ac6b348fc5782da4d38%40thread.skype/GraphQL%2520Workshop?groupId=0064192e-9977-4bbb-a354-0ccc6c80dde8&tenantId=a6b169f1-592b-4329-8f33-8db8903003c7) Teams channel where you can ask questions about the workshop or anything GraphQL related.

Let's start with the tutorial!

## Pre-requisties

You should already have the following:

-   Installed [NodeJS 10 or 12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   Installed [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
-   Access to [BitBucket](https://scm.ecom.ahold.nl/stash/users/maarten.van.oudenniel/repos/sandbox-graphql/browse)

## Contents

-   [Setting up your development environment](./00-development-environment.md)
-   [More information about this codebase and the GraphQL setup](./setup/index.md)

### Fundamentals

A step-by-step or standalone guide to build a GraphQL API and web application. It's possible to start at any chapter. Each chapter contains assignments that are free to implement however you'd like. As a more guided track you can follow the solutions where we build a favorite list app.

You can also start with the projects and use the fundamentals guide as a reference. Chapter 4 is a project to build a Covid tracking application, and in the final project we build a SpaceX application.
